         question one )
         our variables were vary similar the only exception was the underscores were used differently.

         question two )
          yes they had the same birthday  format as us and we used the same variable types.
         instead of doing xx\xx\xxxx we could have done xx\xx\xx for the last two digests of the year

         question three )
         yes, we expected to have the data outputted in a column however the spacing between columns differed,
          we adjusted the spacing by 20 where as Braden's group did this by 15.

          question four )
          yes the formatting was clear and easy to understand.
